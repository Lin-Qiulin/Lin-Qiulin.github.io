                <h3>Competitive Online Optimization</h3>
                <p>This research thrust focuses on developing robust frameworks for online optimization problems constrained by inventories or budgets. Our novel <em>CR-Pursuit</em> framework demonstrates performance close to offline optimal solutions, showcasing its efficacy in diverse applications such as EV charging, peak-demand reduction, and IoT device energy management. We are actively exploring broader applications and theoretical extensions of this work.</p>

                <h3>Intelligent Transportation Systems</h3>
                    <p>Modern ride-sharing platforms present significant optimization challenges due to dynamic demand and real-time operational constraints. My research in this area leverages predictive demand information to enhance system efficiency. We have proposed novel routing paradigms and joint optimization strategies for order dispatching and vehicle routing  that demonstrably improve ride-sharing trip formation and overall profitability. This probabilistic approach has potential applications beyond ride-sharing. My research in intelligent transportation systems extends to optimizing logistics for heavy-duty electric trucks, focusing on minimizing carbon footprint while ensuring timely deliveries. This involves developing approximation algorithms for complex routing problems that consider factors like renewable energy availability ("follow the sun and go with the wind").</p>
